PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

AI Engineering Intern at VoiceQube
Project: Immersive Cinematic Storyboarding with LLM Agents 
Orchestrated a multi-agent workflow using LangGraph and a FastAPI backend for user interaction and modular pipelines. 
Utilized frontier LLMs (GPT-5, Grok-4) as agents for script parsing, shot division, and asset generation with schema-enforced JSON outputs. 
Integrated ElevenLabs for Text-to-Speech synthesis and a SeedDance model for storyboard-to-animation in pre-production. 


Upcoming Internships 
AI Research Scientist (Summer Intern) at Fractal Analytics 
Dynamic Pricing Optimization (Remote Intern) at DiLytics 

RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Cybersecurity in Electric Drives Using Real-Time ML-Based Anomaly Detection 

Developed a detection system for cyberattacks on electric motor drives. 
Engineered a physics-informed LSTM model to transform raw current signals into rich features. 
Achieved over 99% classification accuracy on unseen, microsecond-resolution data. 

PROJECTS

Dual-Mode Lane Detection System for ADAS (Aug-Sep 2024) 
Built a custom dataset of over 650 CVAT annotated frames, enhanced with data augmentation. 
Trained a YOLOv10s model, achieving up to 94.2% mAP@0.50 and an F1-score of 0.87 for white stripes. 
Designed conditional logic to use YOLO when stripes are detected and a Canny Edge detection with Hough fallback otherwise. 
Deployed a real-time prototype with a live GUI for on-device performance tuning. 


Advanced Language Model Engineering & Specialized Fine-Tuning (Apr-Jun 2025) 
Built a GPT-2 style LLM from scratch in PyTorch, pre-trained on Harry Potter books. 
Fine-tuned GPT-2 for spam classification, achieving over 90% accuracy. 
Fine-tuned Mistral-7B with QLORA for medical MCQ answering. 
Developed a hybrid Hangman solver using Transformers and fine-tuned CANINE models, achieving a ~0.55 win ratio. 


Improving Imbalanced Classification using Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks 
Supervisor: Prof. Chandrashekar L 
Trained an HQNN on a 1:577 Credit Fraud dataset, reducing false negatives by 5% compared to classical models. 
Applied a ResNet18 + 8-qubit QCNN on melanoma data, outperforming a classical model by 3% with fewer parameters. 
Trained a 6-qubit HQNN on Higgs Boson data, achieving a Macro F1-score of 0.80. 


Reinforcement Learning Projects 

Implemented SARSA and Q-Learning on CartPole, Mountain Car, and MiniGrid environments. 
Trained Dueling-DQN and MC REINFORCE models on Acrobot and CartPole. 
Developed SMDP and Intra-option Q-learning methods in the Taxi-v3 domain for hierarchical policies. 


Automated Tray-Shifting Mechanism for Vertical Farming 

Developed and patented automated tray system for vertical farming. 
Designed and validated kinematics for tray selection and movement using MotionGen. 
Refined designs and simulations in Fusion 360 for reliable deployment. 


Image Captioning with Transfer Learning and Transformer Decoder (Mar-Apr 2025) 
Used EfficientNetV2 as an encoder with a Transformer decoder, trained on Flickr8k and COCO 2017 datasets. 
Achieved a ROUGE_L score of 0.52 and SPICE score of 0.14. 
Deployed the model using Streamlit for real-time caption generation.
